/**
 * A Cryptonaut sends Messages to other Cryptonauts. This should be done securely, or not at all.
 * To adhere to the security policy, each Cryptonaut is assigned a Lock that
 * ENCRYPTS the Message text when outgoing, and DECRYPTS a Message when being received.
 *
 *      "Communication is the cornerstone of any successful mission.
 *      That's why all Cryptonauts(TM) are encouraged to use SpaceSec's patented
 *      Intergalactic Messaging System(TM). Please remember:
 *        - Messages may experience slight delays due to wormhole congestion.
 *        - SpaceSec reserves the right to read, modify, or misplace any transmission.
 *        - Unauthorized use of "E-mojis" will result in immediate disciplinary action.
 *
 *       Remember, a secure message is a happy message. And a happy Cryptonaut
 *       is one who avoids questioning SpaceSec policy."
